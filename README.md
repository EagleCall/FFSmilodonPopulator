## ForestFey's Smilodon Populator
Adds the biggest known sabretoothed cat, Smilodon Populator, to the RimWorld core game.  
The 2 branches only differ in the animal's capability to carry in caravans, including adapted textures.
Needs no other mods to run and can be added to savegames, but removal is not recommended.
